# Code Explanation: Armstrong Number Checker

## Purpose

This C program checks whether a given positive integer is an Armstrong number or not.

## How it Works

1. **Count Digits Function:**
   - The program defines a function named `countDigits` to count the number of digits in a given number.
     - It iterates through each digit of the number using a while loop, dividing the number by 10 until it becomes zero, incrementing a counter variable for each iteration.

2. **Armstrong Number Check Function:**
   - The program defines a function named `isArmstrong` to check whether a given positive integer is an Armstrong number.
     - It calculates the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
     - It compares the calculated sum with the original number to determine if they are equal.

3. **User Input:**
   - In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
   - The input is read using `scanf`.

4. **Input Validation:**
   - The program checks if the entered number is a positive integer.
   - If the input is not positive, it displays an error message and exits with an error status.

5. **Armstrong Number Check:**
   - If the input is valid, the `isArmstrong` function is called to check if the input number is an Armstrong number.
   - If the input is an Armstrong number, a message indicating so is displayed to the user; otherwise, a message indicating that it's not an Armstrong number is displayed.

## Flow of Logic

- The program follows a logical flow to achieve its purpose:
  1. Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
  2. Check if the input is a positive integer.
  3. If the input is valid, check if the input number is an Armstrong number using the `isArmstrong` function.
  4. Display the result to the user.
  5. If the input is not valid, display an error message and exit.

## Why it Works

- The program works by calculating the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits, and then comparing this sum with the original number to determine if they are equal.
- It handles non-positive input gracefully by displaying an error message.

## Possible Alternatives

- While this solution effectively checks whether a given positive integer is an Armstrong number, there are alternative approaches and enhancements that could be considered:
  - **Using Recursion:** Implement a recursive function to calculate the sum of digits or check for Armstrong numbers, providing a different perspective on solving the problem.
  - **Using String Conversion:** Convert the number to a string and iterate through its characters to calculate the sum, which may simplify the logic.
  - **Using Mathematical Properties:** Explore mathematical properties of Armstrong numbers to optimize the calculation, especially for very large numbers.
