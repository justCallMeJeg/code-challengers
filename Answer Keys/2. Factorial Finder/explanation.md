# Code Explanation: Factorial Finder

## Purpose

This C program calculates the factorial of a given positive integer entered by the user.

## How it Works

1. **Factorial Calculation Function:**
   - The program defines a recursive function named `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a positive integer.
     - Base case: If the input is 0 or 1, the function returns 1.
     - Recursive case: For other positive integers `n`, the function recursively calculates `n * factorial(n - 1)`.

2. **User Input:**
   - In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
   - The program reads the user's input and stores it in the variable `num`.

3. **Negative Input Handling:**
   - The program checks if the input is negative.
   - If the input is negative, it displays an error message indicating that factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
   - The program then exits with a non-zero status to indicate an error.

4. **Factorial Calculation:**
   - If the input is non-negative, the program calls the `factorial` function with the user's input.
   - The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of the input and returns the result.

5. **Result Display:**
   - The program displays the calculated factorial of the input to the user.

## Flow of Logic

- The program follows a logical flow to achieve its purpose:
  1. Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
  2. Check if the input is negative.
  3. If the input is non-negative, calculate the factorial using recursion.
  4. Display the calculated factorial to the user.
  5. Handle negative input gracefully by displaying an error message.

## Why it Works

- The program works by utilizing a **recursive** factorial calculation function to accurately compute the factorial of a given positive integer.
- It handles negative input gracefully and provides informative error messages to the user.

## Possible Alternatives

- While this solution effectively calculates the factorial, there are alternative approaches and enhancements that could be considered:
  - **Iterative Approach:** Implement the factorial calculation using an iterative loop instead of recursion.
  - **Input Validation:** Add additional input validation to handle invalid inputs such as non-numeric or non-integer values.
  - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the factorial calculation function for better performance, especially for large input values.
