# Code Explanation: Prime Number Checker

## Purpose

This C program checks whether a given positive integer is a prime number or not.

## How it Works

1. **Prime Number Checking Function:**
   - The program defines a function named `isPrime` to check whether a given positive integer is a prime number.
     - It returns 0 for numbers less than or equal to 1, as they are not prime.
     - For other numbers `num`, it iterates from 2 to the square root of `num`, checking if `num` is divisible by any number in this range.
     - If `num` is divisible by any number, it's not prime, and 0 is returned. Otherwise, it's prime, and 1 is returned.

2. **User Input:**
   - In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
   - The input number is read using `scanf`.

3. **Prime Number Check:**
   - The input number is passed to the `isPrime` function to check if it's a prime number.
   - If the function returns 1, the number is considered prime. Otherwise, it's not prime.

4. **Result Display:**
   - The program displays whether the input number is a prime number or not to the user.

## Flow of Logic

- The program follows a logical flow to achieve its purpose:
  1. Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
  2. Check if the input number is a prime number using the `isPrime` function.
  3. Display the result to the user.

## Why it Works

- The program works by iterating through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number to check for divisibility, which efficiently determines whether the number is prime.
- It correctly handles numbers less than or equal to 1, considering them as not prime.

## Possible Alternatives

- While this solution effectively checks whether a number is prime, there are alternative approaches and enhancements that could be considered:
  - **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for more efficient prime number generation, especially for a large range of numbers.
  - **Improved Bounds:** Improve the upper bound of the loop in the `isPrime` function to `sqrt(num)` for better performance.
