# Code Explanation: Reverse a Number

## Purpose

This C program reverses a given positive integer entered by the user.

## How it Works

1. **Reverse Number Function:**
   - The program defines a function named `reverseNumber` to reverse a given positive integer.
     - It initializes `reversedNum` to 0.
     - It iterates through each digit of the number using a while loop.
     - In each iteration, it extracts the last digit of the number using the modulo operator `%` and adds it to `reversedNum` after shifting it left by one decimal place.
     - Finally, it updates the number by removing the last digit.

2. **User Input:**
   - In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
   - The input is read using `scanf`.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - The program checks if the entered number is a positive integer.
   - If the input is not positive, it displays an error message and exits with an error status.

4. **Reverse Number:**
   - If the input is valid, the `reverseNumber` function is called to reverse the input number.

5. **Result Display:**
   - The reversed number is displayed to the user.

## Flow of Logic

- The program follows a logical flow to achieve its purpose:
  1. Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
  2. Check if the input is a positive integer.
  3. If the input is valid, reverse the input number using the `reverseNumber` function.
  4. Display the reversed number to the user.
  5. If the input is not valid, display an error message and exit.

## Why it Works

- The program works by iteratively reversing a given positive integer using a while loop and basic arithmetic operations.
- It handles non-positive input gracefully by displaying an error message.

## Possible Alternatives

- While this solution effectively reverses a given positive integer, there are alternative approaches and enhancements that could be considered:
  - **Using String Conversion:** Convert the number to a string and reverse the string, which may simplify the logic.
  - **Using Recursion:** Implement a recursive function to reverse the number, providing a different perspective on solving the problem.
  - **Using Mathematical Operations:** Explore mathematical operations or properties to reverse the number without using a loop, although it may be less intuitive.
