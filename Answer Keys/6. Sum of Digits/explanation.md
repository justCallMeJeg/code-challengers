# Code Explanation: Sum of Digits

## Purpose

This C program calculates the sum of the digits of a positive integer entered by the user.

## How it Works

1. **Sum of Digits Calculation Function:**
   - The program defines a function named `sumOfDigits` to calculate the sum of digits of a positive integer.
     - It initializes a variable `sum` to store the sum of digits.
     - It iterates through each digit of the number using a while loop.
     - In each iteration, it adds the last digit to `sum` and removes the last digit from the number.

2. **User Input:**
   - In the `main` function, the program prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
   - The input is read using `scanf`.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - The program checks if the entered number is a positive integer.
   - If the input is not positive, it displays an error message and exits with an error status.

4. **Sum of Digits Calculation:**
   - If the input is valid, the `sumOfDigits` function is called with the specified number to calculate the sum of digits.

5. **Result Display:**
   - The program displays the calculated sum of digits to the user.

## Flow of Logic

- The program follows a logical flow to achieve its purpose:
  1. Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
  2. Check if the input is a positive integer.
  3. If the input is valid, calculate the sum of digits using the `sumOfDigits` function.
  4. Display the calculated sum of digits to the user.
  5. If the input is not valid, display an error message and exit.

## Why it Works

- The program works by iteratively calculating the sum of digits of a positive integer using a while loop.
- It handles non-positive input gracefully by displaying an error message.

## Possible Alternatives

- While this solution effectively calculates the sum of digits, there are alternative approaches and enhancements that could be considered:
  - **Recursion:** Implement a recursive function to calculate the sum of digits, providing a different perspective on solving the problem.
  - **Using String Conversion:** Convert the number to a string and iterate through its characters to calculate the sum, which may simplify the logic.
  - **Using Mathematical Properties:** Explore mathematical properties of digits to optimize the sum calculation, especially for very large numbers.
